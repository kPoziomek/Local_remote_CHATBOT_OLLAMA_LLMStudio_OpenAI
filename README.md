## This project is about variation of chatbots and AI models

I try to create a simple connection for local agents and AI models.
I use [Ollama]()
I use [LMStudio]()
and [OpenAISDK]()
for this project.

## How to run the project locally run command 

```bash
turbo dev
```
## Remember to have a .env file with the following OPENAI_API_KEY

## This project use LocalLLm so to run it properly you need to have a LMStudio and Ollama running with mounted models.


It was tested and prepared  for the following models:

- Ollama models:qwen3:1.7b
- LLMStudio models: qwen3:1.7b
- OpenAI models: gpt-3.5-turbo
